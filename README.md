# password-generator

This project makes a random password generator. The user is prompted with multiple options, such as whether or not they want to include special characters, numbers, and/or upper and lower case letters.

If the user enters a number above/below certain the set limit (no less than 8, no more than 128 characters), they are asked to resubmit. If the user chooses no criteria, they are asked to resubmit.

Once the user has selected their criteria, the webpage will generate a random password for the requested length and selected criteria as chosen by the user. This will then display on the webpage for the user to copy and paste as needed.
